# Majsoul Bridge

Decodes Majsoul's `lq.*` protobuf-over-WebSocket protocol. Parses and logs
every frame, and currently emits the first mjai event — `start_game` with
the bot's own seat (`id`). Remaining mjai state-machine phases (kyoku, draws,
discards, calls, agari/ryukyoku) are still TODO.

## Seat resolution & names

`MajsoulBridge` watches the `.lq.FastTest.authGame` exchange:

- **Request (client→server)**: `payload.account_id` → stored on the bridge.
- **Response (server→client)**:
  - Seat: index of `account_id` in `payload.seat_list` (0..=3).
  - Names: build `account_id → nickname` map from `payload.players[]`,
    then walk `seat_list` to populate the 4-name array. Robot seats live
    under `payload.robots[]` without a nickname, so they get `""`. 3p
    `seat_list` of length 3 pads the 4th slot with `""`.
- Emits `MjaiEvent::StartGame { id: Some(seat), names, .. }`.

`aka_flag` / `kyoku_first` aren't known yet at authGame time, so they stay
`None` and are omitted from the JSON via `#[skip_serializing_none]`.

## ActionNewRound → start_kyoku + tsumo

`.lq.ActionPrototype` Notify with inner `name = "ActionNewRound"`.

Majsoul deals 14 tiles to the dealer and 13 to everyone else, then the
dealer discards. mjai instead deals 13 to everyone, then emits an explicit
`tsumo` for the dealer's first draw. The bridge converts:

- **We're the dealer** (`ju == self.seat`, payload carries 14 tiles):
  `tehais[seat]` = sorted first 13 tiles. Emit:
  - `start_kyoku` (others' rows = `["?"; 13]`)
  - `tsumo { actor: seat, pai: <14th tile, raw> }`
- **We're not the dealer** (13 tiles):
  `tehais[seat]` = sorted 13 tiles. Emit:
  - `start_kyoku` (others' rows = `["?"; 13]`)
  - `tsumo { actor: oya, pai: "?" }` — we don't know what the dealer drew.

Field mapping from `ActionNewRound`:

| mjai field    | majsoul field          |
|---------------|------------------------|
| `bakaze`      | `chang` → `E S W N`    |
| `kyoku`       | `ju + 1`               |
| `oya`         | `ju`                   |
| `honba`       | `ben`                  |
| `kyotaku`     | `liqibang`             |
| `dora_marker` | `doras[0]` (mjai-mapped) |
| `scores`      | `scores` (3p padded with 0) |
| `tehais[seat]`| `tiles` (sort, see above) |

Tile mapping uses `tile::ms_to_mjai` (`0m/0p/0s` → `5mr/5pr/5sr`,
`1z..7z` → `E S W N P F C`). Unknown tile strings error and the event is
skipped instead of corrupting the mjai stream.

## Meld actions → chi / pon / daiminkan / ankan / kakan

`.lq.ActionPrototype` Notify with one of:

- `name = "ActionChiPengGang"` — open meld. `type = 0/1/2` →
  `chi` / `pon` / `daiminkan`. `actor = data.seat`. `target` and `pai`
  come from the unique non-actor seat in `froms[]`; the remaining tiles
  (where `froms[i] == actor`) are `consumed`. Mjai-mapped via
  `tile::ms_to_mjai`.
- `name = "ActionAnGangAddGang"` — closed/added kan. `tiles` is a single
  tile string. `type = 3` → `ankan` (consumed = 4 of that tile, with the
  red five at index 0 when applicable — every quad of 5m/5p/5s must
  contain the lone red); `type = 2` → `kakan` (`pai` = added tile,
  `consumed` = the 3 tiles already in the existing pon; if the new tile
  is the red five, the existing pon was three normals, otherwise the
  pon held the red).

### Dora flip timing (即乗り vs 後乗り)

Mjai distinguishes two cases — Akagi-Python and AkagiNG both conflate
them and emit dora at the wrong moment. The bridge's `DoraTiming` state
machine fixes that:

| Meld         | Sequence                                      | DoraTiming             |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **ankan**    | `ankan → dora → tsumo (rinshan) → dahai`      | `PendingBeforeRinshan` |
| **kakan**    | `kakan → tsumo (rinshan) → dora → dahai`      | `PendingAfterRinshan`  |
| **daiminkan**| `daiminkan → tsumo (rinshan) → dora → dahai`  | `PendingAfterRinshan`  |

The new dora marker arrives in `ActionDealTile.doras` (the rinshan deal).
`build_tsumo` consumes it when `PendingBeforeRinshan` is set (emit
`dora` before `tsumo`); when `PendingAfterRinshan` is set, the marker is
held in `deferred_dora` and flushed at the next `ActionDiscardTile`,
just before the `dahai` event. `start_kyoku` resets all three fields
(`doras`, `dora_timing`, `deferred_dora`) so stale state from the
previous kyoku can't bleed in.

## Riichi (ActionDiscardTile.is_liqi / .is_wliqi)

Majsoul carries riichi as a flag on the declaration discard, not a
separate action. When `is_liqi` (or `is_wliqi`, double riichi) is true on
`ActionDiscardTile`, the bridge emits `[reach, dahai]` and queues a
`reach_accepted` event in `pending_reach_accepted` (Actor of the
declarer).

Per the mjai spec (`reference_mjai.md` §12 + state machine), the points
deduction is bookkept by `reach_accepted` only **after** the declaration
tile passes through. The bridge implements that as: on the *next*
ActionPrototype event, `handle_action_prototype` prepends
`reach_accepted` to the resulting events and clears the queue.

Two exceptions to draining:

- **Ron on the declaration tile** (next action is `ActionHule`): riichi
  is voided. The queue is dropped without emitting `reach_accepted`.
- **`ActionDiscardTile` immediately after riichi**: shouldn't happen in
  practice (the declarer can't discard twice in a row), so we leave the
  queue intact for the next legitimate action to drain.

> Akagi-Python prepends `reach_accepted` (matches the spec). AkagiNG
> appends it after the next action's events (off by one position
> relative to the spec). Our bridge follows Akagi-Python here.

`pending_reach_accepted` is reset on every `start_kyoku` so a queued
acceptance from a previous round can't leak into the next.

## Game termination — NotifyGameEndResult

`.lq.NotifyGameEndResult` is a *top-level* notify (not wrapped in
`ActionPrototype`). Its `result.players[]` carries final standings
(seat → `total_point` / `part_point_1` etc.) — useful in the flow log
but not part of the mjai stream, since mjai `end_game` has no payload.
The bridge emits a single `EndGame` event and lets the consumer terminate.

## Round termination — ActionHule

`ActionHule` (胡牌) → one `hora` per entry in `data.hules[]`, followed
by a single `end_kyoku`.

| mjai field   | majsoul source                                           |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `actor`      | `hule.seat`                                              |
| `target`     | `actor` if `hule.zimo`, else `self.last_discard`         |
| `deltas`     | `data.delta_scores` (top-level)                          |
| `ura_markers`| `hule.li_doras` (mapped) when `hule.liqi`, else `None`   |

`HuleInfo` doesn't carry the target seat, so the bridge tracks
`last_revealed_tile_actor: Option<Actor>` — the seat whose most recent
action exposed a tile that another seat could ron. Updated by:

- `ActionDiscardTile` — normal ron.
- `ActionAnGangAddGang(kakan)` — 搶槓 (chankan).
- `ActionAnGangAddGang(ankan)` — Majsoul's 国士無双搶暗槓 (only kokushi
  can rob; the server only emits `ActionHule` in that valid case, so
  unconditional tracking is safe).
- `ActionBaBei` (3p) — 胡拔北; pending 3p support.

If we just used the last discard, chankan and the ankan robbery edge
case would attribute the win to the wrong player. A ron with no prior
tile-revealing action is malformed and skipped with a warning. Reset at
every `start_kyoku`.

`li_doras` becomes `Some(vec![])` (not `None`) for a riichi win with no
ura markers, so consumers can distinguish "had riichi but no ura" from
"no riichi".

**Multi-ron**: each `hule` entry produces its own `Hora` event with the
same top-level `delta_scores` attached; the consumer dedupes if needed.

**Riichi voiding**: a ron on the declaration tile clears
`pending_reach_accepted` without emitting `reach_accepted` (state
machine: `dahai → hora` skips the `reach_accepted` branch). The hora
event itself still emits normally.

> Akagi-Python and AkagiNG both reduce `ActionHule` to just `end_kyoku`
> (Akagi has the per-event scaffold but it's commented out). Our bridge
> emits the full `[hora, …, end_kyoku]` sequence with deltas + ura.

## Round termination — ActionNoTile / ActionLiuJu

| Majsoul action | Cause | Mjai output |
|----------------|-------|-------------|
| `ActionNoTile` | 荒牌流局 (exhaustive draw, possibly tenpai redistribution / nagashi mangan) | `[ryukyoku{deltas}, end_kyoku]` |
| `ActionLiuJu`  | 途中流局 — 九種九牌 / 四風連打 / 四家立直 / 四開槓 / 三家和了 | `[ryukyoku{deltas:None}, end_kyoku]` |

`ActionNoTile.scores[]` is an array of per-event point change records;
each carries its own `delta_scores: [4]`. The bridge sums them per seat
into a single `[i32; 4]` (3p deltas of length 3 are padded with a
trailing 0 to fit the schema). Empty / missing `scores` → `deltas: None`.

> The mjai spec text restricts the `ryukyoku` event to 九種九牌, but
> `libriichi` / Mortal use the same event for noten payments and rely
> on the optional `deltas` field. We follow the libriichi convention so
> downstream stat code can attribute the payment correctly. Akagi-Python
> doesn't handle `ActionNoTile` at all; our bridge is more complete here.

If a riichi was declared on the round's final discard and the round
immediately ends in ryukyoku, `pending_reach_accepted` is drained as a
prepended `reach_accepted` before the terminal events (declaration tile
passed through with no ron, so the riichi is accepted).

## ActionDealTile → tsumo

`actor = data.seat` (default 0). When `actor == self.seat` and `data.tile`
is non-empty, `pai = ms_to_mjai(data.tile)`; otherwise `pai = "?"` (we
don't see other players' draws).

## ActionDiscardTile → dahai

`actor = data.seat` (default 0 — Majsoul omits the seat field on the
dealer's first discard). `pai = ms_to_mjai(data.tile)` (must be present;
empty/missing tile is treated as a malformed frame and the event is
skipped). `tsumogiri = data.moqie` (default false).

> Note: `parser.rs` sets `SerializeOptions::skip_default_fields(false)`
> so proto defaults (`moqie: false`, `seat: 0`, empty `tile`) appear
> verbatim in the JSON payload. Logic in `mod.rs` still defaults missing
> fields, so the two are equivalent at the dispatch layer — the visible
> setting matters mainly for the flow log.

## mjai event log

When constructed with an `Arc<Session>`, the bridge rotates a fresh
`<session>/majsoul/majsoul_<ts>.mjai.jsonl` file every time it emits a
`start_game` event, then appends each subsequent emitted `MjaiEvent` as
one JSON line. One file per game; multiple games on the same WS flow
produce multiple files. Without a session (e.g. tests), rotation is a
no-op and only the parsed-frame text log (if any) is written.

## Files

- `parser.rs` — `LiqiParser`, the per-flow decoder.
- `mod.rs` — `MajsoulBridge` that wraps the parser behind the `Bridge` trait.
- `tile.rs` — Majsoul ↔ mjai tile-string mapping + canonical mjai sort order.
- `liqi.json` — method routing table (service → method → request/response
  type names). Embedded with `include_str!`.
- `../../../proto/liqi.proto` — message definitions. Compiled by `build.rs`
  (project root) into a `FileDescriptorSet` (`liqi_desc.bin` in `OUT_DIR`)
  embedded with `include_bytes!`. The Rust message structs are also
  generated but currently unused — `Wrapper` is decoded inline via a small
  `prost::Message` derive in `parser.rs`.

> Both `liqi.proto` and `liqi.json` are hand-placed for now. A future task
> will fetch the latest version from Majsoul's CDN at build time.

## Wire format

```
[type byte] [msg_id u16 LE?] [Wrapper protobuf]
                              ├─ name : string  (method name, e.g. ".lq.Lobby.oauth2Login")
                              └─ data : bytes   (inner message protobuf)
                                        └─ inner DynamicMessage
                                           └─ {name, data: base64(XOR(protobuf))}   (action only)
```

| Byte 0 | Meaning  | Has u16 LE msg_id at 1..3? |
|:------:|----------|:--------------------------:|
| `01`   | Notify   | no                         |
| `02`   | Request  | yes                        |
| `03`   | Response | yes                        |

### Method-name routing

`Wrapper.name` is fully-qualified, e.g. `.lq.Lobby.oauth2Login`.

- **2 parts** (`lq.NotifyX`) → look up `lq.NotifyX` directly in the
  descriptor pool.
- **3 parts** (`lq.Service.method`) → walk
  `liqi.json`: `nested.lq.nested.<Service>.methods.<method>` for the
  `requestType` / `responseType` strings, then look those up in the pool.

Responses carry an empty `name`, so the parser stores
`(msg_id → (method_name, response_descriptor))` in a `pending` HashMap on
each Request and consumes it on the matching Response.

### Action XOR

Some Notify payloads have shape `{name: "...", data: "<base64>"}`. The
parser base64-decodes `data`, runs `wtf_decode`, then decodes the result
as the protobuf message named by `name`. The XOR is position- and
length-dependent:

```rust
const KEYS: [u8; 9] = [0x84, 0x5E, 0x4E, 0x42, 0x39, 0xA2, 0x1F, 0x60, 0x1C];
let base = 23 ^ data.len();
for (i, b) in data.iter_mut().enumerate() {
    *b ^= (base + 5 * i + KEYS[i % 9] as usize) as u8;
}
```

The function is its own inverse (XOR), so the same call decrypts and
re-encrypts.

## Per-flow state

One `LiqiParser` per WebSocket flow. Each flow has its own `msg_id`
sequence, so sharing a parser across flows would corrupt the
request/response correlation.

The proxy handler (`src/proxy/handler.rs`) constructs a fresh
`MajsoulBridge` (and thus a fresh `LiqiParser`) inside `handle_websocket`.

## Adding new behaviour

- **New action types**: just add the message to `proto/liqi.proto`. Pool
  lookup happens dynamically by name.
- **New service methods**: update `liqi.json` (currently hand-edited).
- **Mjai conversion**: add a state machine layer that consumes
  `ParsedMessage` and emits `MjaiEvent`. Game state (seat assignments,
  tehai, doras, …) lives there, not in the parser.
- **Outbound build**: implement `Bridge::build` to take an `MjaiEvent`
  and return the wire bytes (autoplay).

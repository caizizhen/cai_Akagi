# `src/history/` — Game History Recorder

This module persists every cleanly-ended mjai game to a stable, frontend-readable
store. The on-disk shape (under `<config_root>/history/`) is:

```
history/
  index.jsonl              # one JSON-encoded GameRecord per line, append-only
  games/
    <ulid>.mjai.jsonl      # full event stream for that record
```

`<ulid>` is a [ULID](https://github.com/ulid/spec) generated at finalisation
time — lexicographically sortable by start time, doubles as the filename stem.

## Pipeline

```
                    ┌──────────────┐
   MjaiBus  ──────▶ │  recorder::  │ ──▶ HistoryStore.append() ──▶ index.jsonl
                    │  drive_loop  │                                games/<id>.mjai.jsonl
                    └──────────────┘
                            │
                            ▼
                       HistoryBus  ──▶  ipc forwarder  ──▶  "history-recorded" Tauri event
```

A `RecorderState` machine buffers events between `StartGame` and `EndGame`. Any
buffer that doesn't see an `EndGame` is dropped — disconnect-incomplete games
are deliberately **not** persisted (matches the user-facing contract that the
History tab shows only complete games).

## Modules

- **`aggregator.rs`** — Pure function `aggregate(events, ...) -> Option<GameRecord>`.
  Ports `reference/Mortal/libriichi/src/stat.rs::from_game`. Score derivation:
  walk `Reach`/`ReachAccepted`/`Hora`/`Ryukyoku` deltas, then normalise totals
  to 100k (4p) / 105k (3p) by topping up the rank-1 seat. Stat counts mirror
  `Stat`'s field set, scoped to one game.
- **`store.rs`** — `HistoryStore` (JSONL append-only index + per-game event
  files). Single mutex serialises writes; reads are lock-free (re-open).
- **`recorder.rs`** — `drive_loop(store, history_bus, platform, mjai_rx)`. The
  long-running task spawned in `lib.rs::run`.

## Adding a new platform

When a non-Majsoul bridge lands (Tenhou, RiichiCity, ...):

1. Add the variant to `crate::schema::Platform`.
2. Pass that variant when spawning a *per-bridge* recorder. The current code
   spawns one global recorder tagged `Platform::Majsoul` because that's the
   only bridge in v3 — for multiple bridges, mux by source via per-bridge
   `tokio::sync::broadcast` channels or a wrapped event type.

## Adding a new GameStats field

1. Add the field to `crate::schema::history::GameStats` (default-initialised
   to keep deserialisation backward-compatible with old index lines).
2. Update `aggregator.rs` to populate it.
3. Mirror in the frontend `types/history.ts`, `lib/ptCalc.ts` (if it affects
   PT), and `components/history/StatsTable.tsx` (display).
4. Older `index.jsonl` lines will deserialise with the new field defaulting;
   no migration step is required so long as the new field has a `Default`.

## Adding a filter dimension

1. Add the field to `HistoryFilter` (in `schema/history.rs`).
2. Update `HistoryFilter::matches`.
3. Add the corresponding form control in `frontend/src/routes/History.tsx`.

## Don't

- Don't backfill from `<log_dir>/majsoul/*.mjai.jsonl` — those are bridge debug
  logs and may include incomplete / duplicated streams. The history store is
  populated *only* by the live recorder.
- Don't write into `<log_dir>` from this module — keep the two surfaces
  decoupled.
